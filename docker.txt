Dockerfile

add all the required fields
for creating image 


IMAGES
Docker images are a lightweight, standalone, executable package
of software that includes everything needed to run an application:
code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

CONTAINERS
A container is a runtime instance of a docker image. A container
will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure.
Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure
that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between
development and staging.


docker build -t imagename .

docker ps         // for container that are running -a flag for all (that also deleted)
docker images     // for all the images


docker run -d -p 8080:8080 go_docker         //docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port> <image_name>
if we dont specify expose in Dockerfile then need to use -p  (port flag)
-d flag for running in background

docker stop container_id
 
docker system prune  //for remove stopped containers

docker rm -f container-name or id   // f flag for forcefully remove
